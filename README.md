# How to Use

## From executable

Download the latest executable from releases here: https://github.com/SteffenBlake/StackedDeckEVLoader/releases/latest

Simply run the executable and it will generate an `output.txt` file beside it by parsing the latest data from poe.ninja.

Load up your copy of the google spreadsheet (original here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/182eMBmvqe8ifXEtUmt01DN5OFyNcLrTukwOPKKni0oA/edit?usp=sharing) and copy paste the data from `output.txt` into the PoeNinja Data sheet

This should automatically reload the `Expected Val:` value on the `Divination Cards` sheet.
